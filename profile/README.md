## Oneiron
(Ancient Greek) Dream.

Our dream is to bring millions of developers to the [Cardano blockchain](https://cardano.org).
We are doing it by creating **Oneiron SDK** — sidechain development kit for the Cardano blockchain.

With Oneiron SDK, _anyone_ will be able to create a sidechain node with a simple CLI command.

We’re also aiming to create **Oneiron Network** — a Cardano sidechain built with Oneiron SDK, enabling developers to start
building apps _immediately_, with a variety of JVM-based programming languages and without necessarily running their own nodes.
